# Java
Frequently used Java code:
Dont expect much at first. I'm a self taught programmer. Started with VBA (2001) and moved to scripting languages (2003). In Feb 2015 I began working as a contractor for a company and inherited their home grown Java application. I've learned to love Java over that time (6 months as of this writing) and have been working to clean up their code and bring it up to enterprise standards. 
What brought me to GitHub? I am now working to learn web development. I want to take my database and code wrtiing skills to the WWW. My current client needs to bring their home grown apps out to the web. So this is a perfect environment for me to learn.
